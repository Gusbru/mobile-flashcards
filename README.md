This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Below you'll find information about performing common tasks. The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

## Table of Contents

### Installation
To install the application, first you need to have `Expo` installed in your mobile device.
Follow instruction at: (https://expo.io/). 

After install `Expo`, you need to download the FlashCards files:

`git clone https://github.com/Gusbru/mobile-flashcards.git`

When download finishes, enter the directory:

`cd mobile-flashcards`

Inside the directory install the necessary packages:

`yarn install`

Once all packages have been installed, just start the application:

`yarn start`

After start the application, you can run the app by scanning the QR code from
a mobile device, or locally in your machine using a emulator. In principle, 
the application can be run in both iOS and/or Android systems.

We expect to made a public version of this application in the App Store and
Play Store very soon :)

### Using the FlashCards

When you start the application, for the first time, you can see two decks of cards:
React and JavaScript. You can start a quiz with the cards that are already in these
decks. 

You can add new decks, just by tapping the `NEW DECK` tab in the inital screen.

Also, inside each deck, you can add new cards, with answers and questions about
your favourite topic. 

During the quiz, you need to see the answer first, before decide if your answer is
`correct` or `incorrect`. In the end of each quiz, you can see a summary with your
progress status.

Enjoy the app!
