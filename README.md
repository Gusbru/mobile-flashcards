## Introduction

This application is a FlashCard where you can study topics in a fan way, by answering 
questions as registering if your answer is correct or not. In the end, you can see your
progress. Also, you can add more cards to become your studies more fun and efficient.  

This project is part of the React Nanodegree Program from Udacity (https://www.udacity.com).

This project is build using React-Native library and can be run in both iOS and Android systems.

## Using the FlashCards

When you start the application, for the first time, you can see two decks of cards:
React and JavaScript. You can start a quiz with the cards that are already in these
decks. 

You can add new decks, just by tapping the `NEW DECK` tab in the inital screen.

Also, inside each deck, you can add new cards, with answers and questions about
your favourite topic. 

During the quiz, you need to see the answer first, before decide if your answer is
`correct` or `incorrect`. In the end of each quiz, you can see a summary with your
progress status.

Enjoy the app!
